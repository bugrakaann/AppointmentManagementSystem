# Appointment Management System

This Appointment Management System is designed to streamline the process of booking, approving, and managing appointments. The system allows users to schedule appointments based on available hours set by an admin, with an assistant responsible for approving or canceling these appointments. Additionally, users can view their schedules, check available hours, and see which time slots are occupied.
